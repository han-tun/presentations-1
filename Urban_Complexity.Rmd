Urban issues are complex. Increasingly we are using *data* to understand them. From that we want to derive actionable information.

The typical value chain is

data -> analysis -> visualization

I want to talk about the tools I use in this process.

# Census data
I will focus on Census data, but the underlying story applies to other data sources too.

Census data forms the foundation of most other demographic data. It enters in many ways.

* We can work with straight-up census data.

* We can enrich census data with other datasets or geographies.

* Pretty much any other demographic dataset will get benchmarked against the census.

* Census data can provide important context for non-demographic data.

# CensusMapper Architecture

CensusMapper consists of two components.

1. An API server that serves census data mirrored on our database

--

2. A lightweight javascript library that makes API calls and draws map-based visualizations.

---
# How is CensusMapper Used?

* People browse CensusMapper thematic maps



* People drill into regions to browse census data



* People create their own maps, narrate and share them.

# Maps Aren't Analysis

As much as I hate to admit this. Maps aren't analysis.

# CensusMapper API

<span style="font-size:200%">data</span> -> analysis -> visualization

---
# Why API?

* CensusMapper backend is essentially an API server, optimized for serving data for map tiles

* Easy tweak to serve data for download -> Census Data API

* Map-based interface to select geographic regions, searcheable hierarchical list for selecting census variables

# Motivation

* CensusMapper made StatCan census data accessible to non-experts. For mapping and browsing.

* API extensions for non-mapping purposes make custom data extracts accessible to everyone.

* [`cancensus`](https://github.com/mountainMath/cancensus) is an R wrapper for these APIs that makes analysis accessible to everyone.
--

####In Vancouver, our biggest need right now is lack of analysis.

---

# Analysis for everyone?

Maybe not everyone will use this to run their own analysis. But

#### API + R notebook = Fully reproducible and transparent analysis (and visualization)

so anyone can reproduce analysis.

---

# Democratizing data, analysis and visualization

Transparency and reproducibility enabled by 

* API (don't need to bring your own data) and 

* R notbook (just run code to reproduce andalysis and visualization).

**Should become standard as base for public policy.**

--

Or at least as much as possible, not all data can be public. But at least methods and analysis should be transparent.

---

# How does it work?
Let's work through an example.

Vulnerable children is important data for schools to decide how to dedicate resources. Child poverty is one component of this.

As first approximation we want to understand general child (under 18) poverty rates by school catchment area.

For more detailed analysis is [on our blog](https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/10/15/vsb-vulnerable-students/).

All necessary code is included in the slides.

# Child poverty data

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(viridis)
library(tidyr)
library(scales)
```

Loading the census data:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(cancensus)
vsb=list(CT=c("9330069.01","9330069.02"),CSD=c("5915022","5915803"))

  rename(elementary_children = v_CA16_25,children = v_CA16_2513,
         poor_children = v_CA16_2558)
```

Overview stats:
```{r}
data %>% as.data.frame %>% 
  select(children, elementary_children, poor_children) %>%
  summarize_all(sum, na.rm=TRUE) %>% kable(format="html")
```


---

# Where are the poor children?

```{r, include=FALSE}
map_options <- list(
  scale_fill_viridis_c(na.value="grey", option="magma", labels=percent, name="Poverty Rate"),
  theme_void()

```


```{r children, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
ggplot(data %>% mutate(rate=poor_children/children)) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = rate),size=0.1) +map_options
```


```{r children2, eval=FALSE, fig.height=4, dev='svg', include=FALSE}
q <- quantile(data$poverty_rate, na.rm=TRUE,
                      probs = seq(0, 1, length.out=9))

  geom_sf(aes(fill = rate),size=0.1) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(na.value="grey", option="magma") + theme_void()

# Matching with School Catchments
```{r, include=FALSE}

  unzip("schools.zip",exdir="data_cache/schools")
}
data$centroid <- st_transform(st_centroid(st_transform(data$geometry,26910)),4326)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  select(school, children, poor_children) %>% 
  summarise_all(sum, na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(rate=poor_children/children) %>% arrange(desc(rate))
```
Check how many cildren we weren't able to match.
```{r}
summary %>% filter(is.na(school)) %>% kable(format='html')
```

---
# Visual check on match
```{r, include=FALSE}

  geom_sf(data=schools, fill=NA) + check_options

# Poverty Rate by School Catchment
```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
 datatable(summary, options = list(pageLength = 5))
```
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
