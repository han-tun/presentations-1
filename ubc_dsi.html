StatCan data is "open" since 2011. But it's still trying to be become accessible.

How to access and work with Census, CMHC and related data?


---

Some tools to make StatCan data more accessible.

#### CensusMapper
A tool for quick and easy visualization of census data. Also functions
as an API server for pinpointed data access.
#### cancensus
An R wrapper around the CensusMapper API for reproducible workflows with census data.
#### cansim
An R wrapper around the CANSIM NDM API for reproducible workflows with CANSIM data.
#### cmhc
An R pseudo-API (deep beta) that extracts CMHC data for reproducible workflows with CMCH data.

# CensusMapper API

* StatCan is great for bulk census data download

* For more pinpointed data we need an API. CensusMapper offers APIs for 2006, 2011, and 2016 census data, for DB, DA, CT, CSD, CMA, CD, PR, C geographies.

* Map-based interface to select geographic regions, searchable hierarchical list for selecting census variables

# cancensus

Cancensus is an R wrapper for the CensusMapper API. Built together with [Dmitry Shkolnik](https://twitter.com/dshkol) and [Aaron Jacobs](https://github.com/atheriel).

Lives on CRAN and comes [with documentation](https://mountainmath.github.io/cancensus/index.html).

Allows pinpointed access to census data, CensusMapper works as GUI to facilitate data and region selection.

Motivated by [Kyle Walker's tidycensus package](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/). StatCan does not have API's, so `cancensus` ties into CensusMapper APIs.

# Example
How does the net migration effect the age distribution in each municipality?




```r
plot_data &lt;- get_age_data('CA16',list(CSD=c("5915022","5915004","5915055"))) %&gt;% 
  rename(City=`Region Name`)
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Age, y = Population, fill = Gender)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap("City",nrow=1, scales="free_x") + age_pyramid_styling
```

Explain how net migration patterns lead to different age distributions.

# CANSIM

* StatCan just switched over to the New Dissemination Model

* Has 4,797
different dataseries, 2,468 of them ongoing and getting updated regularly.

* NDM makes it easier to explore and process data programmatically. `cansim` R package makes it easy. (Again, built with together with [Dmitry Shkolnik](https://twitter.com/dshkol))

* Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mountainMath/cancensusHelpers), planning to release on CRAN in coming months.

# Non-census data
CMHC provides great housing-related data. It's a pain to download, so I built an [pseudo-API in R](https://github.com/mountainMath/cmhc).





```r
cmhc &lt;- get_vacancy_rent_data(c("Vancouver","Toronto","Calgary","Winnipeg"),"CMA")
ggplot(cmhc, aes(x = Year, y = Rate, color = Series)) + vanancy_plot_options +
  geom_line() + geom_point() + facet_wrap("city", ncol=2) 
```

![](ubc_dsi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.svg)&lt;!-- --&gt;

???
CMHC has recently made finer data available. Sadly no APIs, but we can hack their data portal to speed up analysis. So we built a pseudo-API to consume it.

This graph shows the primary market vacancy rate and the fixed-sample rent change on the same axis. We note the clear inverse relationship between the two, with sometimes strong responses in non rent-controlled Calgary. And yes, rents do drop when the vacancy rate is high.

# Processing census (and related) data
Some related packages that play well with cancensus:

* [cancensusHelpers](https://github.com/mountainMath/cancensusHelpers) -- My package that encapsulates helper functions I frequently use. In a public package so others can reproduce my workflows.
* [dotdensity](https://github.com/mountainMath/dotdensity) -- Good for dot-density maps, but also for re-aggregating data
* [tongfen](https://github.com/mountainMath/tongfen) -- Good for comparing census data across censuses. Census geographies change over time, making comparisons hard.
---

# Bring your own
There is lots of other data out there. Airbnb data is [available via insideairbnb](http://insideairbnb.com). Some people have rental listings data. 
![:scale 80%](open_data_day_2018_files/airbnb.png)

---

# Make your own
If data isn't available, consider building your own database.

# Working with (open) data
Basic rules of thumb:

* Script the data download (and cache the data) for reproducibility.

--

* If you use a workflow twice, refactor it into a function.

--

* If you use a workflow in more than one project, refactor it into a package.

--

* If you use a workflow in more than two projects, clean up your package and put it on GitHub.

--

* If others, including people you never met, are using your package package submitting issues or pull requests, put your package on CRAN.

--

* Use R (or jupyter) notebooks whenever possible, integrates data import, cleaning, analysis, visualization and
interpretation into one document. Can be compiled to html or pdf.

# Projects
Code for the slides is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/mountainMath/presentations), some other presentations with more code too. More worked examples can be found [on my blog](https://doodles.mountainmath.ca), with links back to the R notebooks with the code.

Project ideas:

* CANSIM 35-10-0007 on youth admissions to correctional services by aboriginal status was [in the news yesterday](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/youth-incarcerated-indigenous-half-1.4720019), could use some more analysis by province and normalized by aboriginal youth population.

* Census data has a wealth of variables, can look at individual or combination of variables, and/or at change through time. Browse variables on CensusMapper and see what piques your curiosity.

* Browse cansim variables using `list_cansim_tables()`, there is a lot of interesting data.
