Assessment Data

# What data do we have to understand the housing market?

* BCA property assessments

--

* Average/Median Sales

--

* HPI Home Price Index

* Other models

# BCA property assessments

## Pros:
- property level data, 
- province wide, 
- split between land and building values, 
- comparable timelines since ~2005.

## Cons:
- Low frequency (annual)
- Already half a year out of date when it comes out
- Data availability is spotty. Municipalities are cleared to release assessment data, but not all have the infrastructure to release it, formats vary.
- assessment don't necessarily reflect market value, e.g. Section 19(8)
- quirks

# Analysis based on BCA data

Maps can be embedded in stories, with data, charts and maps tightly interwoven with the story line. For example a story we told about [teardowns in Vancouver](https://mountainmath.ca/teardowns)

Model was build off of non-public BCA data, but trained to run off of public data. So we could tell a detailed story.

# Informing policy
BCA data can be useful to inform policy discussions. 

* [Extra School Tax](https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2018/02/28/extra-school-tax/)
* [Zoned for who?](https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/09/18/zoned-for-who/)
* [Thumb twiddling](https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/01/24/work-vs-twiddling-thumbs/)

# BCA Open Data
BCA data is generally not open. Introduces lots of friction, leads to information asymmetries.

* Even basic data like property assessment values aren't openly available province wide. Some municipalities make it available, but public would greatly benefit from province-wide open data of assessment values.
* Public discussion often focuses on SFH, simply because it's hard to say anything useful about condos. Even if assessment values are available, we need to know number of bedrooms and/or square footage to be useful.
* Big pocket interests have access to detailed (and up-to-date) sales and roll data. Municipalities do not, and the information asymmetry is not in the public interest.

Maybe BCA funding model can be changed from cost-recovery to provincial funding. This would allow to free up the data for everyone's benefit. Real estate is a huge topic in Vancouver, better data (and transparency) can only help.

# Median/average sale price

Pros:
- Simple number to show high-level changes in home prices

Cons:
- Vulnerable to changes in market decomposition
- Can't tell how different segments of the market move

---

# HPI

Pros:
- Simple number to show high-level changes in home prices

Cons:
- Can't tell how different segments of the market move
- Equations are over-specified, there aren't enough sales per month and subarea to fit a robust model
- Requires manual adjustments and time smoothing to get a useful number, 
- Lags the market (because of time smoothing), making it hard to use for point-in-time policy analysis

---
# Other models
Different entities develop valuation models for their own purposes. Models often include a wide variety of data sources, possibly including  BCA data.

BCA model needs to be transparent, others don't have that requirement and can use other methods.

Example of a model not using any BCA data [to create a home price explorer](https://mountainmath.ca/hpe.html)

--
This is more an example of deploying an ML model to a browser than a useful tool, but useful to highlight what other models may do.

# Quiz #1

Seattle has a 0.75 percentage point higher property tax rate than the City of Vancouver. Assume that split will remain constant over time, and take interest rate of 3.75%.

Compared to a Seattle homeowner, a Vancouver homeowner for a similarly assessed property pays significantly lower property taxes.

What is the net present value of the property tax spread on a $1M home?

# Quiz #2

An owner of a single story "mom and pop" store in the City of Vancouver re-develops the property into a three-storey mixed use, with commercial space on the ground floor and two floors of residential space above.

How will this effect the overall property taxes the City collects for that property?
